# CropTypePrediction

Welcome to the Crop Type Prediction project! In this project, we employed various machine learning algorithms to predict crop types based on given features. We utilized K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree algorithms. Additionally, we selected the best parameters for each algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize their performance.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the type of crop based on several input features. Predicting crop types accurately can aid farmers and agricultural organizations in making informed decisions about crop planning, resource allocation, and yield optimization. We explored multiple machine learning algorithms to develop robust predictive models.

## Algorithms Used

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
